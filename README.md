# Geosolver
How good is AI at playing [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/)?
# About
Another computer vision project where we going to train some neutral network to predict country using Google street views from this country. To the best of my knowledge, there are a few papers where deep learning is used to predict some useful stuff using Google street views. This project is not the case. 
# Collecting data
For data collection we need a lot of Google street views from different countries. For that purpose we use [Google 
Street View Static API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/overview).
